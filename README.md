# Curation of FracFocus database for EDA and time-series analysis

## Repo is currently being worked on for the July 18th event!

Requires R \> 4.4.1 and the following packages:

-   'here'

-   'rio'

-   'tidyverse'

-   'janitor'

-   'feather'

Optional (but really nice):

-   'esquisse'

Suggested to have packages installed and the files downloaded and read into the environment, or cached into 'feather' files. The frac_raw object should be around \~2.4 GB in size (6.5 M rows).
